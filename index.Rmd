## Week 1: Getting Organized

You already have an account on the Macalester RStudio server <rstudio.macalester.edu>. Login with your Macalester email credentials.

In this brief session, we will:

1. Get everyone started with using the software for the course. 
2. Install many of the R packages that will be needed for the course.
3. Create a GitHub account and "clone" (using SSH^[I'll show you what this means.]) the repository at <https://github.com/dtkaplan/Comp-110-Assignments-Spring-2017> to give you the files you will be modifying as you work in the course. Once you have done so, please [fill in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEMEn_uHkv4Wm3BDYZ4TU_XxrrSVfXlQ5S7NK0vZvTTm5u-Q/viewform) so that I will know your account name.
4. Clone (again) the repository you created in (3) into RStudio as a "project"" to hold your work in the course.
5. Open the `Week-1-project.Rmd` file in the RStudio editor. You'll put some "markdown" content about a historical event or person into that document, then compile it to HTML, and update your GitHub repository with the new file.
