## Data has all sorts of forms

### Text, e.g. What am I doing? on OKCupid

> currently working as an international agent for a freight forwarding company. import, export, domestic you know the works

> online classes and trying to better myself in my free time. perhaps a hours worth of a good book or a video game on a lazy sunday."

> dedicating everyday to being an unbelievable badass.

> i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance, noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi to try and gently flirt with ego death."

> reading things written by old dead people

> work work work work + play

> building awesome stuff. figuring out what's important. having
adventures. looking for treasure. digging up buried treasure

## Data Tables

We're going to use just one very simple format: the *data table*.

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(101)
Tmp <- BabyNames %>% sample_n(size = 5) %>% arrange(year)
row.names(Tmp) <- NULL
Tmp
```

### Tipi rings in Montana

### Animal tracking

## Cases and Variables

### Anatomy of a data table


![](Images/02_ColumnRow.png)

<!-- Source: <http://www.gcflearnfree.org/access2010/2.2> -->

* A row is always a **case**
* A column is always a **variable**

## What's a variable?



![](Images/02_ColumnRow.png)

A quantity or category that may vary from case to case.

Two main types:

1. Quantitative: a number
2. Categorical: one of a set of discrete possibilities


## Not in Tidy Data

* No units
* No footnotes

Instead, this information should go into a codebook.

Values and Cases need to be commensurate

* Same kind of thing for each case, e.g. don't mix miles and km.
* Within a variable, only the same kind of value for each case.

## Cases

The **object** from which the variables were measured.

Examples: 

* A person, a country, an earthquake, a bike rental
* A person on a date
* A country in a year
* An earthquake and its aftershocks

## Basic Knowledge

1. What is each variable about.
2. What is the kind of object that defines a case

## Tidy Data

Every value for each variable is the same kind of thing as all the other values for that variable.

Every case is the same kind of thing as all the other cases.



## Workflow: Creating a chain of evidence

It's important to be able to state definitely where your data came from.

Part of this is not to edit your data.  Once you have a table, don't change anything in it.

Instead, do your data-transformations in R so that you have a complete statement of how the data you collected are related to your analysis.

## Summary

* Data Table: Rectangular format: cases (rows) and variables (columns)
* Separate analysis from data storage.
* Use a codebook to describe your cases and variables in detail
* Keep your data **tidy**
